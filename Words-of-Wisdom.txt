Words of Wisdom

When Experience becomes Knowledge, When Knowledge becomes Expression

by: Raymond Russ


February 2014 to Present

You cannot and will not grow up unless you go through a few things. What you say means nothing, what you do means everything. Walk by Faith.


You write the sentences that become the paragraphs that become the chapters in the book of your life.


Life doesn't get easier, you just learn to manage the clock and pressure better. It's called maturity.


Eventually you'll stop caring about what others think or say about you. Eventually their opinions and assumptions will have little to no effect on your progress. Eventually happiness will override any sadness that may linger in and around your life. Eventually the sun will overtake the clouds that may hang over you. Eventually love will find a way. Take control and strengthen your faith and good things will come to you...eventually.

People overlook, ignore and avoid the right things for all the wrong reasons.

Despite your best intentions, conflicts will arise.

The people in your corner will tell you one thing. The people in his/her corner will tell them another. Ultimately, their opinions do not matter. It's what you do together, collectively, that determines the progress and outcome of the situation. Combine minds, maintain positivity and look beyond yourself to obtain the best possible result.

If we cannot set aside our differences to compromise for the benefit of more than just ourselves, we add to the destruction of tomorrow. 

Your success (or failure) rate is not based on the opinions, judgement and expectations of others. Live for you and yours. Live within your means. Live to fulfill your dreams. 

We are all going through something. We are all dealing with something. How we endure and overcome these challenging crises is what defines our character. Perception can be troubling if you are only willing to see things from your point of view. The things that we say and do, affect more than just ourselves. Its like tossing a rock into a lake and watching the ripple effect stretch onward and outward. Not everyone is going to be on your team. Not everyone is going to agree with what you choose to do or how you do it. So what? Everyone is entitled to an opinion just as everyone is granted the ability to ignore, disregard and bypass it. Remember that although there may be struggle now, there is a bigger picture to be painted and viewed. Right now is a mere second, a grain of sand in the hourglass. There is a lot of life left to live and a lot of love to receive and give. What is right to you is not always what is right for you. What you think of something or someone is rarely what is factual. If we are not willing to open our eyes, minds and hearts to see, know and feel, we are left with nothing more than assumptions and opinions. If we are not willing to grow, adapt and learn, we are stuck in a state of ignorance and influence. We must lead, for the sake of our children and future generations. We must love, for the comfort and security of ourselves and those around us. We must progress, to continue to develop our bodies and souls for the sake of our sanity and stability. In order to change the world, you must first change your world.

People often wonder why their lives appears so gloomy. First and foremost, you must accept the fact that positivity breeds positivity, the same way hatred breeds hatred. Be mindful of the company you keep. If they arent yet, they will become a direct reflection of you. People often wonder why certain individuals dont acknowledge or accept them, with their kindness, sweet gestures, generosity and all. Here you must accept that not everyone is going to care about you or like you the way you desire him or her to. A square peg cannot be forced into a round hole. Most likely, theyre receiving the same treatment from something (or someone) they want to force to become something that it is not. This basic level karma, treat others the way you wish to be treated, will never be more evident. People often wonder why they feel so weighted down, burdened, sluggish. Stress, worry and depression are unhealthy for the soul. When you realize that you need not concern yourself with what others think or feel in regards to you, youll start to see advancements. You must let the past be the past and focus on the good in and around you today for a brighter tomorrow. The skeletons in your closet are yours alone to acknowledge and deal with. No one elses opinion will have a thing to do with how you go about your plan, path and course of action. Take your concerns to your Creator, release that which drags you down, break the chains of the weighted stress, break away from misery and watch your progression quicken. Take care of you and treat yourself right.

Everyday I see an overabundance of complaints from a multitude of individuals in regards to the opposite sex. This prompted me to acknowledge and emphasize a few ideas that often times get overlooked. First and foremost, you must recognize that happiness is something that starts from within you. Too many people are looking for or relying on others to fill a void, provide joy or rescue them from the point and place they currently reside in on their life course. Secondly, who and what you think you want is not always what is ideal for you and your future. With social media and trends, people tend to be influenced by types and stereotypes. A lot of your prior heartache and suffering is a direct result of you chasing, latching on to and desiring the idea of things and people who are, in reality, no good for your spiritual and emotional growth and development. Next up is the concept of effort. Typically (but not always true) the people who put in the most time and effort are usually the ones who find you the most interesting, appealing, beautiful. They may not appear to be exactly what youre looking for, but in the interest of attention and effort, there may be one who is deserving of your time and effort. If you cannot reciprocate the appreciation and adoration to one who has a genuine interest in you, why complain when you receive that same treatment from another? Think about what it is you truly want, then think about who is actually willing to provide it for you. Lastly, there will always be a plethora of options, a never-ending list of people, decisions and choices. Use more than just your eyes and choose wisely. Do not get too far ahead of yourself. Do not become too engulfed in the past and what has already come to pass. Truthfully, what you want, need and deserve is already available to you, it is just a matter of making the time and effort to take on the opportunity. He/she/it likely already exists in or around your bubble. Sometimes it will require a bit of change, a bit of stepping outside of your box, going against the grain, taking a chance, but you will never know unless you give it a try. We all want to love and be loved, but what are we willing to do to be in the position to give it, receive it and keep it, the right and righteous way? Just a thought.

Look beyond what's obvious, hear what isn't said, feel with more than the ability to touch, learn to avoid assuming. There's more than what's on the surface, more than the eyes can see. 

I hope you open your mind and see, beyond what you think and believe, I hope you dream amazing things to bring into reality, I hope you give respect and joy to any and everyone, I hope you feel and experience abundant and authentic love, I hope you sing songs of happiness so the world can hear your sound, I hope you spread, positivity and faith all around, I hope you live your life to the fullest with success and few regrets, I hope you commit to your ambitions and responsibilities and always give your best, but most of all I hope you strive for spiritual wealth, by doing this one simple thing, never stop loving yourself.

Value the time and effort you invest into someone or something. Time wasted is often time you cannot get back. On the contrary, appreciate the time and effort that someone or something invests into you. Times missed are often times you cannot get back.

Some days I wake up and choose not to reach out to anyone, not to initiate any conversation or communication just to see who thinks, cares and feels as I do. Truth is, not everyone you hold a spot for in your thoughts and heart, reserves a similar spot for you. A lot of those same people choose not to reciprocate the love, admiration, respect or generosity you throw their way. At the end of the day, it is quite alright. For the select few family, friends, associates who do give the love right back to you, show your utmost appreciation to them. They get it. And never disconnect from the unlimited, steady streaming source of love, blessings, knowledge and positivity that comes from your Creator.

There are people that you know, know of, knew, see, talk to, ignore, dislike, detest, assume about or know nothing about in and around your life and world that are going through and dealing with things you may not know or realize that could be a painful, depressing burden upon them. With all the hatred and negativity floating around and happening on a daily basis, take time out of your day to be someone's light in the dark. Smile, shake someone's hand, give someone a hug, tell someone you love them, kiss your her (or him) like its the first time. We never know what the next second may bring and waiting until it's too late is never easy to endure. If I know you, I love you. If I don't know you, I love you. If you hate me, guess what...I still love you.

The easiest way to promote, instill and share happiness and love requires no words at all. A lot can be said with a simple smile.

I embrace being uniquely different. I'm often misunderstood, misinterpreted. Those who know me, get me. Everyone else is irrelevant. Sometimes you have to let people know how much they matter to you. On the flip side, sometimes people need to know how much their existence, words, assumptions and so on, do NOT matter. I'm not always right, but neither are you or anyone else. Respect is still a major part of the puzzle known as a relationship. Try knowing folks before you go talking about them. Try knowing folks before you absorb any gossip about them. And if anyone continues to disrespect, dishonor or bash your character...I prefer the old reliable life philosophy myself; Kill them with kindness.

Be more than a pretty face, a lovely body, a stash of cash, a collector of material items. Way too much time is spent trying to outdo and impress others. Don't let their "likes" be greater than the love you possess for yourself. Don't sell your soul for the attention or the spotlight. What do you want to be remembered for?

Imagine being a part of a group, community, society or world that does not glorify everything that is wrong or goes wrong day in and day out. Imagine being the inspiration or driving force behind a change for the better, as opposed to a provider of opinion without action. Imagine silence instead of hatred, love instead of tragedy. Imagine individuals not trying to impress or outshine one another with possessions, cool factor, imagery. Now stop imagining, stop talking and do something to make it a reality. Be the difference.

When you learn to hold yourself accountable for your words, actions, ideas and mistakes, you'll find that you're less concerned with, disappointed in or amused by what others say or do. Those who talk about you will rarely, if ever, approach you with their opinions, assumptions and criticism. So worry not, if you keep God in your heart, no harm will come to your soul. "I'm way up, I feel blessed." Always believe in you.

Typically, there are two methods for you to get attention. You can be acknowledged, recognized and praised for your actions, character, personality and effort. On the flip side, by utilizing the shock and awe method, along with flaunting your appearance, possessions and talking down to and about others to make yourself look better, you also can gather the attention of others. Who are you trying to be? What do you want to be known for? Don't try too hard. Don't try to be something you're not. Don't sell yourself for a little shine. One fact remains true, the prettiest people do the ugliest things.

Mistakes are God's way of teaching us life's lessons. If we do not learn from them, we are bound to repeat them which in turns leaves us buried in the hole we've already dug ourselves into. Seek opportunity, growth and reform. The goal should always be to become and evolve into a better version of yesterday's you, as you travel upon your road to righteousness and enlightenment.

The list will grow shorter, the path will grow wider, the weight will become lighter and the view will become clearer. Cutting off, letting go, moving on and overcoming are all a part of this progressive thing called life. Don't waste time on the wrong ones. Don't overlook the right ones. See the positive in others but do not ignore who they really are when the true colors are revealed. Never be afraid to move forward alone. Sometimes it's necessary to reach our destination.

Judge them not on their status, their situation, their money or lack there of, their past, their mistakes, their possessions, their kids, the rumors that surround or follow them, for only God should judge. Remember a diamond is made under pressure and gold is discovered while digging through the dirt. The joy you seek may be right under your nose. Quit seeking perfection and learn to accept and receive the blessings that exist in and around your world already. We all deserve the happiness we long for.

Don't allow the idea of being liked, to become larger than the reality of being loved.

I will always be the first to admit I make mistakes, that I am flawed and imperfect. However, I wholeheartedly embrace who I am and have become. Never will I ever change my personality or alter my character to fit the desire of another. God created me as I am for a reason. The more time and experience teach me, the more I realize that being exactly what I want and need for me and those that depend upon me is my main obligation in this life. The difference between being alone and loneliness is a matter of how YOU feel. Be thankful for who you are, what you have and who is consistently in your corner. The main point I'm trying to make...be yourself.

They say we are all fighting a battle no one knows of. Everyone struggles daily with something that tears them up inside. Skeletons exist in all of our closets. We experience death in the form of accidents, suicide, overdose, murder, natural causes yet what do we do to offer change? We experience pain in the form of loss, lies, cheating, bullying, inequality, war, depression and loneliness. Often times we stay in situations longer than we should. Other times we don't allow enough time for opportunities to blossom. We look past the evil of those who remain evil. Other times we bypass the good of those who may have stumbled along the way. We choose like over love, image over character, media over reality, quantity over quality. There also exist times when we sell our beauty and soul for limelight and temporary monetary gains. At the end of the day what do you have? When the sun sets and you look in the mirror, what do you see? Do you know what your purpose is? Do you know who you really are? You can wait on a perfection that will never come. You can seek a fairy tale that will never become reality. However, you can also accept and embrace your gifts and blessings and make the most of them. Too often we settle for less than what it is we deserve. Other times we sell ourselves short by not taking a chance on that which scares us or appears to be a difficult challenge. Nothing worthwhile comes easy in this life we lead. If happiness is what you desire then happiness is what you'll experience if you learn to love yourself and accept what this world and what your God presents to you. But nothing will ever change unless you take the necessary steps to make it happen. Take off the shades, open your eyes and see with your heart and soul. If you think this may be about you, chances are it is. Make a change.

Quit complaining about what he, she or they did to you. We've all been through something. Yes it hurts, but so too does a hangnail, paper cut, bruise, broken bone ...to get to my point, this too shall pass. The pain lasts as long as you allow it to by focusing on it instead of a means to fix it. That bruise or broken bone eventually heals. It may very well leave a scar but with the proper treatment and effort, it will fade away and you will get better, and become once again, as good as new. Self love is the best love.

I just want to be heard, forgiven, acknowledged, respected, liked, loved, accepted, trusted, supported, pushed, understood, praised, touched, intrigued and blessed. In short, I just want to mean something to someone or something. Let my purpose be worth it. I'm only human.

Dear ladies,
I am by no means a woman basher nor the hating type. Just a few observations and opinions I wanted to elaborate on. Before I go in, just know that I love you all dearly...
With that said, enlighten me on what you consider a "thirsty nigga". How can a female post overly enticing photos and statuses to draw in men, gain sexual attention and then turn around and be offended when men respond to certain behavior? What were you expecting? Then beyond that, the quality of men don't live up to your expectations and you wanna down the gender? On top of that, you adore the attention but complain about receiving messages and comments from men responding to your posts, your pictures, your cries for attention? Help me make sense of it all. 
Women are the most confusing species on the planet, yet man can't live without them. Women are the root of our existence but carry the most emotion. What is it that you truly want? You will fight for and go to war for a man who has little to nothing going for him or you, and has done you wrong or currently mistreats and misleads you. But in reality will deny a good man, who has a future and his life together. For what? 
Our generation is a mess all because y'all think that what you see and what you're fed is what you want, need or deserve. Social media and hip hop make it okay to be a baller, yet we overlook the job or work put in to become said icon. It makes it okay to be an entertainer or exotic dancer but just because media glorifies the art doesn't mean it is something to be proud and dignified of. Imagine if your mother was a stripper? Would you be proud of that? Imagine if your mom was half naked with her blessings on display for social media? Would you embrace that? If you had a child, would you be supportive and happy with your daughters decision to sell her looks as a means to gather popularity, money, attention? 
Women used to be the building block of a family. The foundation for what a home was built on. I still believe in tradition, in happiness, love, longevity and the woman being a queen. As I said in the beginning, this isn't a denunciation or meant to cause any drama. I just want women to be and live up to the true meaning behind their purpose and existence. Regardless of the life you choose to lead, you're still a part of the most beautiful and precious species on the planet. Have faith, dignity and respect for yourself. Be the queen you were created to be. Don't sell yourself for a little shine. Don't utilize your looks as a means for attention, survival, or income. 
Be more than you're appearance. Seek more than a "right now" guy. Stop acting like your inbox is some sacred, hallowed location where only certain men are permitted to establish your acquaintance. We all know, in the real world, you get back what you put out. You receive what it is you seek. Our world continues to spin out of control and love has lost its value, meaning, purpose. With that said, what is it that you truly think, hope, believe you deserve or want? By all means....share your opinion. Real men want to know, and, as a real man, I still love you all.

Things can change in a flash, how quickly the present can become the past, but the things that are built on faith and love are those that tend to last. You can sit around and wonder, you can wish and hope and dream, trying to decipher every word, every action to see what they truly mean. I don't know where I'm headed, but I know this much is true, there is nothing beneficial for me seen in my rear view, so if you're coming with me, be kind, be honest, be true, I've got a lot left for me to do and see, and I wouldn't mind sharing with you. What lies ahead....

Don't leave too soon but don't wait until it's too late. Don't pretend not to care but certainly avoid stressing yourself out. Learn from yesterday but don't plan too far ahead. Be humble when you're right but apologize and correct things when you're wrong. Make choices that you'll love and can live with, no one wants to be stuck with regret. Treat yourself with respect, but let us not forget to treat others the way we desire to be treated. Every word or action that you say or do cannot be justified for God created us imperfect for a reason. Life is not meant to always go your way. Sometimes you just have to put it to your mouth, suck it up and swallow that pride to be or become a better you.

We spend much of our adult lives chasing, pursuing and thinking about what it is we think we want. All along, what we need and deserve is placed in plain sight, right in front of us time and time again. For an array of reasons, we tend to overlook, bypass, ignore and shun away the blessings delivered to us for some strange belief that it isn't good enough or what is meant for us. Turning down what God gives us too many times may leave alone in this earthy world, and spiritually, no one is meant to be alone.

Expectations still bring about the greatest disappointments in relationships. Learn to accept them for who and how they are, what they do or do not have, as opposed to trying to make them change into what you wish they should be. Be yourself, allow them to be exactly who they are. If it isn't enough, they say the sea is full of fish.

The best education we can provide our children is not found in schools. It is the morals, values, experiences and lessons that should be the seeds we plant within them. And it is these seeds we must grow, develop and nurture that make the greatest impact on what and who they will become.

It is normal and natural to have differences in opinions, the true testament to us as people, is how we come together to compromise and overcome.

When someone thinks they know you based on the opinions of others, they've already ruled themselves out for time, effort and attention.

Why are we so set on having expectations of others that we ourselves are not willing to reciprocate?

Its quite alright to be weird, unique, strange, different as long as you are being 100% you. Have no shame. Don't worry about the attention or popularity. Being original > following trends. Be yourself.


If you have to ask for one more chance on more than one occasion, chances are your behavior isn't going to change or improve. 

God is always working. It's most evident when blessings (whether it be a need, desire, assistance, a person or an opportunity) just randomly arrive when least expected. This is why, whether life is cloudy with a chance of rain or bright with abundant sunshine, I pray and give thanks every single day.

The opportunities that you routinely complain about that you do not receive, may very well be the same opportunities, offers and interests that you so quickly write off, ignore and deny. There is no "perfect", there is only the investment of time, effort and faith to reach the destination in life, love and happiness that you so desire. If your life sucks, if your love life is non-existent, if you often find yourself alone and unhappy, chances are most of the blame starts with and within you.


Effort is commendable. Lack of is shun. You get back what you put in, at least that's what they say.

What you claim you want does not become what you have unless you actually put forth effort, try, pursue opportunities and take chances. Otherwise, you'll be left talking about what you don't have and complaining about a lack of opportunities. In most cases, you only have yourself to blame for what or who is or isn't in your life.

It isn't always about age. Eventually you reach a point of adulthood and maturity when you don't really care who stays, who goes, who plays and who blows. You learn to appreciate what you're blessed with, you learn to accept what you lose, you learn to improve and build on what you have, you learn to release what isn't beneficial for your journey. In the overall scheme of things, it's ultimately what or who makes you happy that becomes what's worth your investment. Everything else is toxic, poisonous and child play. Treat yourself, don't cheat yourself.

The respect, love and reciprocation you desired from the wrong one, imagine when you get it from the right one. The devotion and commitment you poured into the wrong one, imagine when you provide it to the right one. We will lose, we will fail, we will hurt, we will be heart broken....Doesn't mean we stop. Keep loving and keep living. What's meant to be yours, still is.

Don't waste your days, hours, minutes and seconds waiting around for a fairy tale, perfection, or a so called "the one" individual. Life will come and go and the things you're waiting for may never come to fruition. What we once knew was a mere dream, but what we know now is better than any fantasy could render. You have to go out and find, pursue and fight for what it is your heart desires. It's kinda like the lottery, you can wait around to strike luck on a fortune, or you can work hard and build your empire with dedication, effort and drive.

You can talk about it as often as you feel the need. However, the fact remains, if you aren't doing anything, you're doing nothing. Think about it......
.......then act.

Sometimes you have to resort to treating others how they treat you, which means you may have to treat them like they're nothing, or just don't treat them at all.

There's no need in regretting the time you invested and subsequently wasted on those who were not in the same place as you spiritually or emotionally. Instead give thanks and be appreciative of whatever emotion they drove you to, whatever lesson they inadvertently taught you, whatever blessing they may have set you up for. Healing follows the pain as sure as sunshine follows the rain. Feel free to take from this what you need, take it to the heart or take it personal.

The happiness and peace you desire often resides just outside your front door, outside your level of comfort, outside your list of desires and wants. So what that means is sometimes you have to step outside of your own little box to reach the levels you seek. Risk, chance and opportunity...fear them not.

The funny thing is, whomever it is you think you want probably already lives in your friend zone. 9 times out of 10, you've already skipped over, walked by or ignored him or her.

What's the purpose of a pretty face if you're pretty ugly on the inside? Is it more valuable to be a leader or to lead someone on? When did communication stop becoming a two way street? When did ignoring someone you actually see and know, become an actual response? Why is it that people will turn to social media to vent problems, emotions, opinions, but fail to resolve them with the source(s)? Is love still a feeling or just a word? Is there really happiness in settling and being unwilling to walk away? When does commitment, love, happiness, become more of a priority than "I'm doing me"? You're right here, right now, but what's next? If you never take a chance or step away from what you're comfortable with or used to, do you really expect the end result to change?

It's all fun and games until you realize the only person who is playing games is you, and there isn't any fun in that. That's the moment when life itself, not another person, tells you to grow up.

Don't you dare entertain me if it's just to waste my time. Please don't treat me like another who's just standing in a line. If I'm just not good enough being uniquely me and If you cannot match my level of effort or energy, then leave me be. 
Looking behind me to see where I've been doesn't really show you who I am these days my friend. Listening to what they say of me doesn't mean you know who I am my friend. See me in this place, in this place, take in my words, my actions, my expressions. Face to face time offers the best of impressions and teaches lessons.
Get to know me. So you can know me. So I can know you. So we can know.

If it doesn't add up, don't force the math. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. If your heart hesitates, may your mind follow with sound judgement. If it causes you pain, do not be afraid to walk away. Every claim, expression or statement does not deserve a response. If you're unhappy, don't pretend to be otherwise. Unacceptable behavior does not deserve your justification. To sum it all up, never settle for less than what it is you deserve, what it is that brings you joy, what it is that completes you.

It's never too early to rediscover yourself, your happiness or to start over. Sometimes life's greatest blessings come after you walk away from what used to be, who you used to be. Good days follow the bad as sure as sunshine follows the rain. Shine on my friend.

If we continue to let the past dictate the present, what's meant for us going forward may take more time and effort to reach and achieve. Let go of your mistakes, your failures, your disappointments. Learn to live in the now. Don't let opportunities fade away, pass you by or go to waste due to what's already come and gone. It never hurts to plan, but do not overlook what's in front of you, right here, right now. Seize your moment.

Never forget, we are born and built to fail. Every empire in the history of man has crumbled. What defines you is not how you fell or failed, but how you chose to rebuild, overcome and bounce back. Dwelling on what has gone wrong will only delay you from the rights that await you. May you remain aligned with the truth, the way and the Light. He is always on time. May your lessons evolve into blessings.

If it's an answer you seek from her or him, you can find it in their response, actions or reaction. It's YOUR time, don't let THEM waste it.

When you're not okay, sometimes it's beneficial to carry yourself as if you are. If they've hurt you, sometimes it's beneficial to keep it to yourself. If they don't care for or acknowledge your effort, typically it's beneficial not to have expectations in others anyway. If something special presents itself to you, it's usually beneficial to accept the blessing and opportunity. Otherwise you may be stuck with the same pain, suffering, feeling of disappointment and regret for far longer than you should.

We have to stop acting like time is unlimited. We have to stop putting things off until later, stop avoiding situations, people and opportunities for fear of failure. We have to stop allowing the past to dictate or influence the decisions that we face. There is no harm in being patient but, no door remains open forever. Yesterday is a lesson, today is a blessing and tomorrow is no guarantee. Let go of what disappointed or hurt you. Embrace what currently makes you happy. Accept the good that comes to you....because in the end, you never know.

Sometimes you have to step outside of your circle of friends for venting and consultation. How can they give you proper advice about something they don't have or know little about? Are they reliable enough to tell you what you need to hear as opposed to what you want to hear? Is their opinion based upon what is best for you or what they want for you? You circle grows smaller as time goes on. Be grown, be wise, represent you.
Advice is nothing more than a recommendation. In the end, you are responsible for your own ideas and decisions. Be cautious, for the words others feed you may have little to do with what is best for you, and more to do with their own motives. Always try to see the good in people, but don't be oblivious to their odd behaviors and/or negativity. Facts > opinions. Experience > hearsay. Respect > jealousy. Loyalty > treachery.

None of us are without problems which also means none of us are without solutions. None of us are without skeletons in our closet, which means none us are unable to close that door to move past them. None us are without fear, which means none of us are without courage. Life is all about perception. The difference between good and bad, light and dark, happiness and sorrow, all rests in the eyes and soul of the observer. Thinking positive will give life to positivity, just as negative thinking will create negativity. Despite it all, love yourself.

I'm just trying to find my place. Trying to secure my peace. Trying not to let anyone bring me down or steal my joy. I'm just wanting to belong. Wanting to stay strong. Wanting to be happy and be free. I refuse to lose myself. To lose my mind. To lose to the thoughts of my past and my mistakes. I'm going to give my all. Give my love. To have what I want, who I want, who I want to be. I'm growing into a better me.

We have to stop blaming others for the way we act, react, think and feel and start taking responsibility for our own thoughts, beliefs, actions and emotions. We need to stop focusing on that which is broken, and invest our efforts into what is already together and can be strengthened and built upon. Just because you're accustomed to something doesn't mean it is right, okay or acceptable. Yes the unknown can be scary, but everything we have encountered and endured was once a mystery to us. We need to utilize logic and common sense when we move forward and look behind us as little as possible. We have to recognize and accept that love starts within and cannot be given to us from another. Happiness is merely a state of mind, and if you have it, cherish it. If you seek it, do what you can to achieve and maintain it. Being bitter, hateful and heartless does more damage to ourselves that it does to others. Who you portray yourself to be is what others will perceive you as, so why not be you? Age is irrelevant, color is nothing more than a reflection of light, religion is merely a means of faith and belief. Your life is yours. Give, love, smile, try and be happy for there exists no known expiration date for when your time is up. Live it up and make the most of it.

We all acquire and enjoy attention in some form or fashion from time to time. There is nothing wrong with that. Just be sure the attention you receive is for a valuable and meaningful purpose. Don't just be the "phat ass", "big titties", "sexy body", fancy outfits, possessions, jewelry, cars, likes, comments. You, my friend, should be and should desire to be recognized for much more than that. Be the smile, help, nurturer, supporter, inspiration, motivation, role model, guardian, companion, friend, parent, beautiful soul you were created to be. May your actions be the evolution of your words. May your heart be kind, even in the face of hatred, deceit, disappointment, and mistrust. May your face radiate love. May your positivity spread like a disease and infect everyone you come in contact with, with a smile.

How true it is that we often cause our own grief, stress and worry the majority of the time. We wait when we should proceed. We hold on when we should let go. We hesitate when we should take advantage. We run when we should stay. We stay when we should run. We assume instead of seeking facts. We settle when we should seek better. We rely on others instead of loving ourselves. We don't give ourselves enough credit for who we are. We trust when we know we should be skeptical. We smile when we should cry. We cry when we should smile. Sometimes doing the opposite of what we think, feel or believe leads to the right place, answer, or situation. Don't let your heart overtake your mind. Don't let your mind drown out your heart. As confusing as it may seem, at the end of the day, your faith and the ability to balance life's unpredictable moments is your most reliable source for peace, stability and the potential for happiness. Love yourself yes, but also be in love with you are and desire to become.

Foolish are those who assume without research, who rely on the words of others instead of seeing things and people for themselves, for speaking on subjects without proof or knowledge of the topic(s). Be certain of your words, emotions, ideas before acting on them. In other words, think before you act. Age matters not. This is how your maturity is measured.

The individuals who you like, love, consider great and/or amazing, are just as human as you are. Sometimes we forget that as people we are all flawed, imperfect and born into sin. Mistakes will be made. Regret may creep into your cycle occasionally. Judge not. Forgive often. Avoid negativity, run from hatred. And always try to respond and react with kindness and love. Do better. Live better. Be better, but first, love yourself.

If you spend the majority of your time listening to or believing what others say, how will you ever develop your own opinions or perspective? Independence. Individuality. Intelligence. All begin with the letter I.

If it's attention you seek, you're doing life wrong. If you're craving friends, you're going about it wrong. If hurting others is a goal, you're likely struggling with your own confidence and stability. If hatred is in your heart, you've obviously missed out on the love train. If you need others to fulfill your happiness, then you clearly need to rediscover your own joy. If the words and actions of others dictate your emotions, then you need to put in more effort with and for yourself. If your faith tank is on E, you may need to acknowledge your creator and find hope. If you say you're done with it, be done with it. If you make a claim, be sure your actions follow accordingly. If you want it, you actually have to pursue and fight for it. If you routinely place blame on everyone else, you likely need to face the mirror and accept your own flaws and faults. If moving forward is an objective, it is vital you let go and move pass the past. I promise there is more than this, than what is bothering you or holding you back. There is more to life. It could always be better, but it can also be much worse. Be thankful, grateful, build on the good that exists. Take advantage of potential and opportunities. Quit being a follower, create your own path. Being different is good. Having your own is good. Sometimes you have to let go and move on without those you think you need in order to reach the place you're supposed to be. Be calm. Be poised. Be patient. Be kind. Go for it.

When it comes to your time, effort and heart, if they cannot match or respect it, then they're only holding you back and keeping you from the additional happiness, comfort and success that awaits you. Never be afraid to let them go, cut them off or move on without them. Be all that you need. Independent and self-sufficient equates to an abundance of good brought to the table. Show me what you got...

Sometimes the wisest choice is to stop trying, stop speaking, stop giving, not react. It is in the moments, hours and days that follow where you will find out who cares, who misses you and who truly appreciates your time and effort. But If they say or do nothing afterwards, look at it in the most positive light. They can no longer be a waste of your time, heart or energy. Life, as it always has, will go on.

Sometimes reminding others is a reminder in itself, to yourself: 
I'm not here to be what it is you want me to be. I don't expect you to give or be what I need. I simply pour out my soul and give as much of me and what I have to not only improve my own life and well being, but also to have some sort of positive influence on your life as well. I want what I want. I have what I need. Being social, outgoing, friendly, giving, caring does not mean I have a motive or expectation of you. It's merely me being exactly who I am and how I choose to be. Judge me if you want. Assume about me if you need. Let their opinions of me dictate how you view me but at the end of the day, I'm gonna continue to do, be and live just how I always have. I do this for me and that in which I'm responsible for. If you're on board or on the team, welcome and thank you. If not, I'll pray for you, I'll be there for you but if you cross me, that bridge may go up in flames.

We are all going through something. Entering something. Coming out of something. Instead of judging, try loving. You never know who needs it.
No one can fight your demons but you. God grant you the strength. 

You cannot help someone who does not want it. You cannot support someone in moving forward if they do not desire to progress. No matter how nice you are to certain individuals, they may still react with hate, negativity and hurtful words. Remember though, you are not their problem, they're just struggling with their own demons. No matter how many times a person says they are going to change, it never actually becomes that change without the actions to generate it. Similarly, no matter how many times a person says they are going to do something, it doesn't really matter until they actually do it. Sometimes we just need to focus on ourselves. Other times we can't help but to help. There are moments when we have faith in others and end up disappointed. But in the end, we are all seeking the same peace, joy and stability. May your vision be sharp. May your choices be wise. May your mistakes be minor. May your heart be strong. And may happiness be with you more often than not.

Sometimes your level of happiness is simply a matter of which direction you're facing. Looking forward will supply more hope, opportunities and joy than looking behind you.

On the verge of setting some new policies and limits. I'm a firm believer in communication and consistency. If you can't initiate an intellectual conversation, don't bother. If you cannot respect me enough to respond when I reach out, don't bother. If you take the time to read what I share, observe or like what I post, follow me but don't really care for or about me, don't bother. If you don't know me, but you're open to allowing the opinions of others to dictate our relationship or interactions, don't bother. If you're set on judging me or anyone for that matter, but think you're free of flaws, sins, demons, skeletons, don't bother. If you feel I don't deserve your time or friendship, feel free to delete or block me. At the end of the day, the last thing any of us needs are fake friends, half assed relationships, false hope, unnecessary drama, rumors, gossip and people who are only around to observe our every move, attempt to tear us down, or degrade and belittle us. I know of a lot of people. I associate with a lot of people. But I'm only loyal and committed to the ones who love me, respect and accept me as I am and hold me down no matter what. If you don't love yourself enough to acknowledge and accept what you deserve, then you are your problem. Say what you feel.

Have you ever stopped to think maybe what you consider "your type" might not actually be your type at all? If your desired qualities, standards, traits in a partner have more to do with appearance and face value than character and intellect, chances are you've probably encountered a failed situation or two. There is no harm in shooting for the stars, trying to land the quick fix, dream person or situation, but we must also be humble, reasonable people and respect ourselves enough to have sound judgement and make logical choices. Stop letting outside influences and opinions affect what you want for you. Avoid trying to force things that just aren't meant to be. Do not be so quick to dismiss something or someone because of the past, hearsay or circumstances. It's highly likely you've either done or encountered the same types of issues along your journey. Quit creating excuses for the why you can't or won't and make a genuine effort to see the benefits of the I can and I will side of the coin. Be willing to step outside of your box, take a chance. Risk is a vital part of life. Like a blind leap of faith, sometimes you have be willing to just try. Happily ever after may be one smile, one unread message, one yes, one response or initiated conversation away. No one should ever be too good, too busy, too anything for their own love and happiness.

Do not worry. People will always have plenty to say about the things, ideas and people they do not know or understand. Lack of knowledge is defined as ignorance. Myths become legend when spread by word of mouth. Many will buy into a story having never seen it with their own eyes. A claim without evidence is defined as an assumption. They may throw dirt on a name, bury one deep and squeeze peace from another with hearsay, defamation and slander. Coal under intense pressure is defined as a diamond. Shine on.

Don't invest too much time avoiding opportunity if you're just going to complain about what it is you don't have or receive. Do not blame your past if your current mindset is still focused on the same kind, type or situation from before. Most of what you have or what you receive is a direct result of your own output and decisions. Embrace who you are and what you possess. Try not to place yourself on any kind of pedestal for we all are equals in the eyes of our Creator. You are never too good for anyone or anything. Do not apologize to others if there is no sincerity in it. The consequences of your actions are lessons, accept the result. Learn from it. Birds of a feather do indeed flock together so be mindful of the company you keep. May gossip or hearsay have little to no influence on your opinions. Stop rejecting the blessings and chances that present themselves to you. Your pot of gold or happily ever after may be a trip, call, text or message away. Have Faith always and seek forgiveness for your mistakes and poor choices. Never settle, the difference between content and happy is not the smile you put on your face but the joy, butterflies and excitement within your heart. Regardless of what others may think, feel or say, always, ALWAYS choose your heart.

Whether it is a possession, feeling, person or relationship, sometimes giving up is the most beneficial choice. Knowing when to leave or let things go can save you from prolonged hurt, stress, struggle, sadness. It isn't giving up because you can't do it, it's giving up because you're deserving of something better, greater. You've got to love and respect you.

No matter the situation or circumstance, one experience does not make you an expert of anything or anyone. 
A mature individual will respect your opinion but it does not mean it holds any more or less value than that of the next person. 
The people, things and situations you speak negatively about probably feel the same way about you. But not everyone reacts to negativity with negativity. 
Turning the other cheek. Turning a blind eye. Some people are equipped with the ability to ignore and avoid that which is unworthy of their attention. 
We all have room for more growth, improvement, change, knowledge.

The Love you seek is not found in a person or a thing. It is not something you can force upon a situation, similar to the way you cannot make a flower bloom on demand. It takes the right light, moisture, temperature and environment for that. Love is discovered outside of your little box, outside of your comfort zone. In order to have it you must not be afraid of the unknown. The blessings and opportunities placed within your path represent the difference being just living on earth and having your heaven on earth. Without risk and chance you're bound to remain short of what it is your truly want, need and deserve. Trust in Faith.

I'm anxious to know what goes on in people's heads nowadays. Like, what stimulates your mind? What motivates and drives you? What grabs your attention? What turns you on? I regularly see posts from folks openly expressing their feelings about being single but, why exactly are you single? The easiest thing to say is men/women suck, but we all know in reality that is not and cannot be true every single time. Maybe it's your standards or lack thereof. Maybe it's your previous choices or your taste in men/women. Maybe it's your level of expectation. Maybe it's due to the influence of hearsay, gossip, opinion. Maybe it's your assumption of their situation or what they may or may not have to offer. Maybe it's a matter of maturity or where folks are in life. Is it appearance? Job? Possessions? Living situation? Kids? History? Popularity? Social media status? What exactly is it that you want or are looking for? Inquiring minds, hearts, potentials want to know.

If there is something you wish to say or something you feel you need to do, do not wait. Do not put it off or delay. Although time may be infinite, our time on this earth is not. So make the choice and the effort to say and show that you love them or that you're sorry. That you think the world of them, appreciate who they are and what they do. That you're in love with them body, mind, spirit. Nothing after this very moment is guaranteed.
Don't spend too much time respecting and worrying about other people and their feelings, that you forget to make you and your own happiness a priority. Avoid stressing them, especially when they aren't thinking about you at all. Never change who you are to become what they like. Be yourself. Who cares what they think. Smile often. Smile regardless.

If you wait too long for the perfect moment, your perfect moment might pass you by. Because these days are numbered and I promise, life isn't waiting for you....

Don't just look beautiful, but be beautiful as well. And by be beautiful, I mean be fair, be honest, have a heart, give without expecting returns, love without limits, live without hate and avoid thinking you're better than anyone or above anything.
It makes little sense to preach about loyalty and commitment only to turn around and willingly select friends or partners who clearly do not share those same ideals. Then to follow the situation up with complaining about them being disloyal or uncommitted when you knew what they were about from the start. You can't change anyone who does not want to change themselves.


I'm not sure how you feel about yours, but I consider my time to be precious and valuable. With that said, do me a favor and not use yours to waste mine. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.


I don't care whether I'm liked or disliked for what I believe, what I have or what I look like. I only aim to be loved and appreciated for what I give, what I do and the faith, hope and drive that radiates from my heart. Spread love. Spread positivity. Often times what you're looking for is not found on their surface, you've got to dig deeper to the source to determine what, who and how they are. Do you eat the shell or the egg?

There has to be a balance between being selfish with your heart and being considerate of his or her feelings. A little goes a long way. May your words and your actions align to produce positive, beneficial results for yourself as well as others. Sometimes, happiness relies on this concept.

Being defensive, judgmental, critical or over analytical will have you pushing away, overlooking or missing out on the opportunities you should probably take.

You're never going to be 100% ready and it's never going to be just the right time, but that's the point. It means that every moment is also the right moment. If you want it, you just have to do it. For everyone that says they're not ready, it's not the right time, there's too much going on, I am overwhelmed. I want to but I can't, this one is for you. 

So much of people's social time and energy is devoted to trying to tear down, expose, hurt and belittle others. If people treat you negatively and your public response is negative, what message are you spreading? What makes you different than him, her or them? When people say they don't care about your personal business, they aren't trying to come across as rude; they're simply trying to let you know that some of the situations that you routinely share, talk about and post should be dealt with in real life. There is enough hatred running wild in the world already. Why contribute? What do you gain from trying to destroy another? People may like it or jump in and add their 2 cents, but in the overall scheme of things, they're likely laughing at you while you decrease your own worth for that 15 minutes of attention. And there it is....it's always the ones who shouldn't have an issue with getting it but will sell their soul for...the attention.

The vibes and effort you put out will determine the energy you receive. If your world is peaceful and positive, you know why. If your world hectic and dramatic, you know why.

People fight to find it. People fight to keep it. People weep when they lose it and people celebrate when they have it. Some stay for the wrong reasons. Some stay despite being unhappy. Others bail because it's opportunistic while some leave believing the grass is greener on the other side. Many fear the idea of something new, something different. There are those that are so judgmental that they avoid or deny what may be right for them. There are those who rely on hearsay, rumors and opinions to make their determination. There are the too nice, too social, too good to be true individuals and situations that get overlooked or ignored. Attention, popularity and appearance often times take place of the things that should matter most. Then there are the individuals that are just plain terrified of it. Regardless of all of these things, it's obvious that it is one of the most complex, challenging yet vital parts of our existence. If it were easy, we'd all have it and all would be right in the world. Or so it seems. It's hard to settle on it but we can't live without it. It comes in many forms, shapes, types. Love is embedded within our hearts and meant for each and every last one of us. May you be blessed with not the love or lover you want, but the love or lover you deserve. They say what's meant to be will be, but don't neglect the fact that you have a hand it that outcome. If it makes you smile and feel good on the inside, who cares what anyone else thinks. Go for it. Your happiness is what's at stake.

Life is full of roadblocks, obstacles, challenges, mistakes, regrets and disappointment. You are blessed with the strength to bypass, overcome, plow through and move beyond all of the above. Don't let hurt, sadness or frustration conquer you. May your smile after the pain be like a rainbow after the rain. Trouble don't last always.

The quickest route from beautiful to ugly is to have an attitude or personality that does not match your appearance. Being attractive does not grant you the authority to treat any other being poorly. They say the eyes are the windows to the soul. May your windows reveal love, peace, positivity and equality.

It's not a matter of being good enough nor a point to be what he or she claims they want. At the end of the day, just being uniquely and exactly who you are along with striving to become a better version of yourself is all you'll ever need to be. If they're not receptive to what you have to offer, it isn't your loss or you missing out, it's you avoiding a situation that wasn't worth your time nor meant for you. Dedicated to the pretty along with the pretty ugly.

You may think it's being considerate or being nice by skating around questions, requests and inquiries but sometimes it's appropriate and correct to just answer yes or no.

If you're not in the situation or companionship you desire, chances are it's because you're overly invested in what's entertaining, attractive or cool right now, as opposed to what's beneficial, efficient and full of happiness and stability tomorrow, in the future and for the long haul. Readjust your focus and you'll be more apt to discovering or stumbling across the "it" that you truly desire and deserve.

Everything that you've gone through and endured has prepared you for the position you're in and the direction you're headed. Be thankful for every decision, every mistake, every fall, every comeback, every failure, every success. And although we are all on different paths, there's no harm in being positive, supportive and encouraging towards others. Positivity has a far greater reach than hatred and negativity is typically a call for help or attention. Let's grow.

Stop wasting everything that is valuable and beautiful within you on situations and people that are unworthy and do not belong around you. What you allow will continue to occur. As long as you entertain bullshit, so too will it continue to exist.

We need to raise the bar when it comes to expectations. Think ahead. Think smarter. Instead of screaming Free So and So after they get locked up, why not scream "Stop doing dumb shit before you get locked up"? That's supposed to be your friend, your people, your partner, your family right? We're losing so many loved ones, young ones to addiction. Instead of having to mourn at the loss of or condemning addicts for their problem, why not invest your time and energy into helping them? You could be the change or difference. Quit following trends and glorifying ignorance. If we continue to allow and enable the use of these invented sounds and made up words, eventually we will regress and start sounding like cavemen. Reality TV is not reality, stop trying to be what you see. Show more appreciation and attention to the women and men actually being involved parents to their children. There's nothing cool about being a sperm donor, baby daddy or baby momma. Class is sexier than ass. Stop standing all awkward with your leg looking broke just to poke your booty out. Quit taking pictures in a dirty ass bathroom. Love is more valuable than money. The word "thot" does not make being a whore an acceptable thing. Stop disgracing the purpose of marriage with infidelity. Quit judging people. You yourself are no better than him, her or them. Come on down from that high horse. Start healing, stop killing. Spread peace.

Marriages and relationships tend to fail because people view the connection from man's point of view instead of God's point of view. Also, if you're in it, focus on him/her. The moment you look at something else, persuasion and curiosity sneak in. Moral of the story, if you're going to commit to something, do it wholeheartedly and for the right reason. Don't just be a statistic. Be the right statistic.

Continually dwelling on and pushing an issue that has long since been over is the equivalent of beating upon the carcass of a dead horse long after its passing. I'm fitting to call the animal abuse hotline on y'all.

Often times the most logical plan is to step back, observe and assess. Their actions, effort, communication or lack thereof, will let you see what they're really about as well as where you stand with them. Don't force the issue upon them. Don't make excuses for them. Don't ignore any red flags that may arise. Things not coming into fruition also serve as beneficial to our growth. Let's bloom.

Do not neglect the signs and answers that people provide to you by not responding, replying or acknowledging your inquiry or interest. Don't allow your desires, hopes or feelings to make excuses for their actions or lack thereof.

You can't force anyone to care. You can't force anyone to be who you want them to be. How it makes you feel is far more important than how it looks. How it treats you means far more than how it looks. You can't skip the rain to just jump straight into the sunshine. Things take time. Situations and relationships that make it and last are those that endure the storms. Be an individual with Independent logic, ideas, opinions. Avoid the influence of digital trends and pressure from those around you. Unplug from the machine. Love more with your heart. Lust less with your eyes. With the choices that you make, it's your happiness that's at stake. What good is physical beauty if you're spiritually ugly?

Companionship. Communication. Consistency. Courtesy. Not Confusing. Not Complex. Not Complicated. Not Careless. Cool? Cool.

Don't drag folks along. Don't just expect them to get the hint. Don't lead people on. Don't build them up only to let them down. Don't claim to be an adult only to indulge in childish games. Don't give false hope. Quit ignoring people. Consider how you treat others. Now imagine you being in their shoes. Would it be just as easy, smooth or cool if it were to happen to you? This is why people say dignity, respect and chivalry are dead. The way you treat, speak to, react and respond to others is a reflection of who you are, not what you think or assume of them.

Bring your hopes and beliefs to life. Don't just say it, live it. Terminate the attention you give to the unappreciative and the disrespectful. This in turn, will open the door for more positive, quality people and opportunities. Knowing your own worth will allow you to view, with clarity, what it is you deserve.

Don't allow how folks act or react towards you to dictate the type of person you choose to be towards others. By the same token, don't be oblivious to those who feed off of you and take your kind heart and giving nature for granted. In short, be yourself, change for no one, and remove any toxic entities from your cycle/circle.

Never be afraid to cut people off or to let them go. Sometimes in order for your own progression, growth, stability or happiness, some of the weight of others must be removed to reduce the stressors of your journey. Don't allow false hope or unappreciated feelings/effort hinder your decision making ability.

Funny how everything tends to come full circle. The feeling you get when someone doesn't treat or acknowledge you a certain way is the same exact feeling you're giving someone else for the same reason. Don't over-invest in what you think you want just to ignore what God often shows you what it is you need and deserve.

If you allow the pain and disappointment of yesterday to linger, the joy and peace that you seek will shift further and further into your future. Yes we do need time to deal and heal, but learning to move on and move forward will lessen the pain and limit the time of suffering. The past can't be changed. The future is yours to create.

I'm a very peaceful, positive individual. I seek the same successes, liberties, happiness as the next well-minded adult. I try to avoid ever putting down or hurting another and in the same breath, I accept and manage any negativity or hurtful activity aimed towards me. Failure is a part of the process. Disappointment is a part of life. I am no different, no lesser, no greater than you. I've been hurt, lied to, led on and let down.... But I'm still here and still 100% me. Even in moments when I want to lash out, retaliate or air out people for the actions they've taken against me, I always end up on the course that rises above that moment of weakness. A lot of our stress and anxiety is rooted in feeling for and worrying about people and situations that shouldn't even earn a grain of sand on our beach of life. Learn to let it/them go. If it didn't work, if they messed anything up, that was their way of showing you how much of your time, effort and heart they deserve. Absolutely none. I'm done.

Every failure, every setback, every situation, relationship or interest that did not work in my favor, I am forever grateful and thankful for. The things that do not come to fruition are usually your Creator's way of protecting you from something or someone that isn't meant for you.

It is important for us to find the strength to weather the storms we endure, but from experience, its easier said than done. What is the solution when calls for help, company, concern go unnoticed, unanswered, unacknowledged? Joy is less about what you do for you and more about what you do, give and provide for others. Help.

It is commendable of those who fight for and put in the effort to save, keep or maintain a relationship or situation they hold dear to them. The same is not said of those who accept and put up with deceit, disloyalty, cheating, violence and other criminal activity in the name of what they believe to be love. If that's what you allow or believe you deserve, what does that say of your self-worth? Priority number one should always be you, your heart, your happiness. Don't settle for anything other than what makes your soul glow, makes your world complete.

What one man doesn't appreciate and takes for granted is a never ending, priceless treasure to another. Fear not what you deserve. If you feel more is meant for you, trust that feeling. Instinct exists to protect you as well as point you in more positive, promising direction.

If happiness is non-existent in your situation, you're already treading in troubled waters. Do not disregard the feeling within your heart. Don't overlook the potential that is the opportunity in front of you, for fear of the consequences. Misery is often self-inflicted. Why fight for something that likely will never come to fruition, when God is presenting the blessing to you that fulfills that void? Don't be content with what has been when you know that what you deserve is so much more.

The best way to know about anything or anyone is still and always will be the old fashioned way, invest the time to learn first hand. Assumptions and second hand chatter will leave you misinformed and possibly missing out on the opportunities you desire/deserve. Communicate. Ask questions. Hang out. Don't limit yourself to social media, hearsay and technology.

It's so complicated trying to separate optimism from expectation. It's as if they go hand in hand. You want to believe in someone, something, some situation but often times we allow our past or others to possess a portion of the control that determines the outcome. You give a chance, with hopes of another taking it. You express yourself with hopes of another appreciating it. You share love with hopes of it being reciprocated. In the end, it either comes together or fades into the realm of nothingness. Regardless, every open door, promising situation, pleasant surprise is worth the risk. Disappointment visits us often. Happiness is a rare find. Go with what makes you laugh, smile, comfortable.

If your opinion or assessment is not built from facts, research, direct contact and/or experience, it becomes a representation of ignorance. 

Loyalty is the result of trust. Trust is the result of honesty. Honesty is the result of respect. Respect is the result of maturity. Maturity is the result of growth. Growth is the result of experience. Experience is the result of time. Time is limited. Don't waste my time.

We spend so much of our lives yearning for opportunities and happiness, yet we allow negative experiences and the pain from our past more authority over anything with potential to be good, beautiful or worthwhile. We hurt others because we've been hurt. We push people away over fear of the unknown. We implement the wittiest of excuses to justify running away, being unavailable, avoiding the obvious with intentional obliviousness. We find ourselves being mean to those who do not deserve it, repeatedly drifting to those who do not deserve our time, investing more interest into the attention rather than the genuine. A false sense of pride is the means of avoiding regret. The desire to be alone contradicts the sorrow that accompanies loneliness. So much of the brokenness, emptiness, pain and trauma we endure is the result of our own fears, obsessions, choices or lack thereof. Replace fear with Faith. Focus more on what's in front of you and dwell less on what has already come to pass. If it makes you feel good, warm, happy, loved, well dammit maybe it's something worth trying. We've been blessed with tools such as heart, gut instinct, intuition, spirit, soul; to not only protect us but to guide us, to assist our minds when our thoughts are flooded with confusion, worry, anxiety. Life is only so long. So live, love, cry, smile, but always, always keep progressing, continue to press forward. Beautiful things are meant for you and are there for you. Close your eyes and explore your inner self, it is only then that you'll truly be able to see.

We all endure struggle, whether internal or external. Some of us more than others. Situations will fail. Hearts will break. We will lose, cry, breakdown. But we also will win, smile, bounce back. It is and always will be the never ending circle and cycle of life. One man's trash still remains another man's treasure. What glitters is not always as valuable as diamonds and gold. Often times the opportunity of a lifetime has been right beside you, in front of you, around you, waiting for you to grasp or acknowledge it. Do not abandon your pursuit of happiness. Do not be blind to the gem(s) already present in your world. Observe it, recognize it, go for it.

Chivalry is very much alive and well. Times have changed. Expectations have changed. Social and gender equality have advanced dramatically. The real problem lies within our decision making. You choose who and how you are. You also choose who you accept and commit to. You have the choice to have what you deserve or settle for less than that. Regardless if situations are healthy or horrible, you possess the choice to leave or stay. Honestly, a lot of what we complain about in our personal lives is a direct result of our own choices. It isn't all men/women, it's the ones you choose or have chosen. Making excuses, pointing fingers and shaming is not gonna help anything or make things better. At the end of the day, the simplest route to a more positive outcome; use better judgement, respect yourself and your heart, make better decisions.

Things I believe we all desire: love, comfort, trust, stability, support, security, financial security, friendship, companionship, intimacy, faith, respect, family, peace, harmony, happily ever after. There's nothing stronger or greater than hearing an "I love you" that includes all of the above. Excluding the opinions and influences that surround you, what are you doing to acquire what it is you truly want?

Time. Time. Time. There's always such a significant emphasis on time. Wasted. Waiting. Rushing. Bought. Loss. Right now has always seemed like the best and right moment to take action. Risk. Chance. Happiness. Satisfaction. Love. The time is now.

Change often times is a positive thing. Traumatic events provide you with an opportunity to do better, have better, live better, be better and be happy. Quit dwelling on everything that goes wrong and start giving attention to the things, situations and people who truly love you, support you and believe in you. Yes, time does give you the opportunity to heal or recover but it also leaves you vulnerable to drown in your sorrows, feel bad for yourself, or in a position to make poor decisions because you think it's okay. It's not. Do not lose sight of what it is you believe, deserve and desire. It feels good to smile. I wanna give you reasons to smile.

If your present is strongly influenced by your past, then your future will include much of the same. Never fear change; for change is normal, natural and necessary.

A blessing doesn't come in the form of what you want but as what you need. The strength of the blessing depends on whether or not you choose to acknowledge and receive it. Stop looking and feeling with your mind and eyes. Start observing and reading with your heart and soul. You are your greatest obstacle.

Never feel bad or hurt for loving someone when it isn't reciprocated. Either way they likely need it. Loving in itself is a gift that you should never regret doing, giving or expressing to another.

Fighting for something can often times be an unwinnable challenge. Sometimes letting go, looking ahead, moving on, although it may appear difficult, is the best course of action in our pursuit of happiness.

You can live your entire life waiting for something to become what you want it to be, only to find out it wasn't meant to be. You can attempt to force love into a situation that isn't built to support it. You can give up on your own happiness just to be content with what is already in place. You can make excuses to stay, make excuses to leave, make excuses as to why you can't move on but in the end you're left with nothing but regret chasing behind those excuses. You deserve what you want and what you need. Stop waiting for something or someone to change or become what it is you seek. If they were about your joy, it would already have come to fruition. Don't waste your years, your time, your life on people and situations that don't fit into your plan, progress and future. Do not fear the uncertainty that accompanies change. You have a hand in writing your destiny. Invest in what makes your heart warm, in what makes you smile.

My apologies if I seem to be a disappointment to you but the fact of the matter is, at the end of the day, the only expectations I'm obligated to meet or fulfill are those that I've set for myself. Everyone is fighting their own battles too, that also includes me and you.

Some people aren't built for emotion or love, while others have been so hurt, broken or damaged, they're unable to recognize real love when it reveals itself to them.

Eventually you reach a point where you don't feel obligated to defend yourself against anyone trying to bring you down or deliver drama to your world. It also grows much simpler to just let things go, cut people off, continue your journey instead of engaging in unneeded negativity. Be observant, remain vigilant, people who change up on you without explanation or communication likely were never on your team to begin with.

You've conquered a great feat when no one can you love you greater than yourself.

Failure to respond is an obvious lack of communication and also a strong sign of disinterest. There's no reading between the lines for the writing is plastered on the wall. No one is too busy for the things they like, enjoy or desire.

Running back to the same things, people or types, typically gives you the same disappointing results that you've previously endured.

I lend an ear more often than I lend a suggestion. I aim to build, bring peace and laughter to others. I do not seek attention nor do I give too much to others. Balance is my routine and prayer is my practice. My blessings are my abilities, gifts, talents...I shall continue to master my craft. World, take me as I am.

May your words put forth support for their will and not ignite worry. May your words combat against hate and magnify glory. May your words be more than just words and detail your story. May your words attract happiness and faith and be devoid of anger and fury.

Often times the right thing to do and the hardest thing to do are the same thing; and the best thing to do for you.

Regardless of the situation you're in, you're seeking, you're afraid to accept or trying to escape, never overlook or forget what it is you truly desire and deserve. May your heart and happiness remain YOUR top priorities.

Never change who you are to fit in or to be accepted/approved of by another. If they want you to change for them, they don't respect or appreciate who you already are. If it requires you to change to be a part of their community or group, they don't deserve your presence or attendance. The only person you should ever want and need to change for is yourself, it's naturally built into our ongoing individual growth.

Actions, Reactions, Interactions or lack thereof, typically reveal what a person thinks about or feels towards you. Train yourself to accept those people and situations for exactly what and who they are.

You aren't perfect but you are enough. Your flaws are nothing more than your soul's decor. Your dream is never too big to pursue. Your desire is never too unimportant to just overlook, dismiss or give up on. Your mistakes are learning experiences. Your heartache is temporary. Your own value is always greater than any label or level you place on it. If "what is" doesn't stimulate your mind or warm your heart, and "what could be" is an invasion of butterflies in your stomach, settling probably isn't the right option.

Regardless of who has hurt me, talked bad about me, lied on me, lied to me, played me, mistreated me, used me, screwed me over or developed a not so pleasant opinion of me, I have been and will continue to remain unbothered, unchanged, non-retaliatory, genuinely and unapologetically me.

It doesn't matter how you frame it or how often you say it, the words hold little weight without any action to push the agenda.

Don't let the picture fool you. There are plenty of people smiling for the camera who are miserable behind the scenes.
